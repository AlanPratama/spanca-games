In the tutorial, we go through the source code of this game. We cover, how to set up a Three.js scene with box objects, how to add lights, how to set up the camera, how to add animation and event handlers. We also add textures with HTML Canvas and learn how to draw 2D shapes in Three.js then how to turn them into extruded geometries.
